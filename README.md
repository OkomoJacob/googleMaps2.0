### Introduction

### Setting up your Flutter Environment

### Getting started with Google Maps API for Mobile and Web
The first step is to add the Google Maps Flutter plugin as a dependency in the pubspec.yaml file.
- To do so, run this command in your project directory 

```shell
flutter pub add flutter google_maps
```
Or you caan mannually add it in the `pubscpec.yaml` under the dependencies `google_maps_flutter: ^2.1.1`.Replace the 2.1.1 with the latest version.
